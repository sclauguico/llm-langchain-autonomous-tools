Here's our itinerary for our upcoming trip to Europe.
There will be 5 of us on this vacation trip.
We leave from Denver, Colorado airport at 8:45 pm, and arrive in Amsterdam 10 hours later
at Schipol Airport.
We'll grab a ride to our airbnb and maybe stop somewhere for breakfast before 
taking a nap.

Some sightseeing will follow for a couple of hours. 
We will then go shop for gifts 
to bring back to our children and friends.  

The next morning, at 7:45am we'll drive to to Belgium, Brussels - it should only take aroud 3 hours.
While in Brussels we want to explore the city to its fullest - no rock left unturned!
